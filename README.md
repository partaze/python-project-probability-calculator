# python-project-probability-calculator
This project is part of freeCodeCamp's certification course. The assignment question can be found at: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/probability-calculator . prob-calculator.py contains a class that creates a hat object filled with different colored balls as per defined within initiation. The balls are randomly drawn and the probability of drawing predefined balls per given number of trials is calculated by a function outside of the class. main.py and test_module.py were provided by freeCodeCamp. Feel free to test out probability-calculator.py with the test module :)
